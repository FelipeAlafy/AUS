Creating a library.

Please note that the recommended way to distribute an AUS library is with it being official 
in the licensed libraries archive. For your library to become official, please confirm that 
it follows the documentation file, where you hear the MANDATORY mark, make sure that this 
same method is included. This to maintain compatibility with * .aus files. Finally, get in 
touch with a moderator to have your library revised. Later, you will receive an email saying 
if it was approved or not. And if not the reasons.

Also note that if your library is left out of the most recent MANDATORY, it may for a long time 
be removed and disapproved.

If your library is under the GPL V3 license, we will not be able to approve it as official 
because it forces the codes that use it to be GPL, use LGPL instead.

If you decide to discontinue your official AUS library, please contact us so that we can place 
it as discontinued, and then remove it.
